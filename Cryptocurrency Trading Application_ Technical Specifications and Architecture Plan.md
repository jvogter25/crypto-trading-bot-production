## Requirements Analysis

### MVP Features Analysis

#### Stablecoin + USD Auto-Trading Engine

The core component of the application is an automated trading engine that represents a sophisticated approach to cryptocurrency trading with built-in risk management through USD reserves. This system addresses several key challenges in cryptocurrency trading: volatility management, profit preservation, and systematic decision-making.

**Functional Requirements:**

The trading engine must continuously monitor real-time price feeds for five selected stablecoins through Kraken's WebSocket API. The selection of stablecoins as the primary trading universe is strategically sound, as these assets typically exhibit lower volatility than other cryptocurrencies while still providing trading opportunities during market fluctuations. The engine should implement multiple technical indicators including Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Moving Average crossovers, and volatility triggers to generate trading signals.

A critical feature is the automatic extraction of 10-15% of gains into USD reserves after each profitable trade. This mechanism serves multiple purposes: it locks in profits, reduces exposure during uncertain market conditions, and provides capital for future opportunities. The USD reserve management system must be sophisticated enough to partially redeploy reserves when strong trading signals emerge while maintaining a core balance for stability.

The system must handle Kraken API downtime gracefully through a fallback queue system. This resilience feature is crucial for maintaining trading continuity, as cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and API outages can result in missed opportunities or unmanaged positions. The queue system should store pending trades and execute them when service is restored, with appropriate validation to ensure market conditions remain suitable.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

Performance requirements are stringent due to the real-time nature of cryptocurrency trading. The system must process WebSocket price updates with minimal latency, ideally under 100 milliseconds from receipt to decision. Order execution should occur within 500 milliseconds of signal generation to capitalize on market opportunities before they disappear.

Reliability is paramount, with the system requiring 99.9% uptime excluding planned maintenance. The trading engine must implement comprehensive error handling, including network failures, API rate limits, insufficient funds, and invalid orders. All errors should be logged with sufficient detail for debugging while maintaining system operation where possible.

The system must support both live trading and paper trading modes. Paper trading is essential for strategy validation, parameter tuning, and risk-free testing of new features. The paper trading mode should simulate real market conditions as closely as possible, including order execution delays and slippage.

#### Trading Performance Dashboard

The dashboard serves as the primary interface for monitoring and controlling the trading system. It must provide real-time visibility into system performance, trade history, and portfolio allocation while remaining accessible across desktop and mobile devices.

**Functional Requirements:**

The dashboard must display current holdings across all stablecoins and USD reserves with real-time updates. Portfolio visualization should include percentage allocations, current values, and profit/loss calculations both in absolute terms and relative to initial investment. The system should benchmark performance against buy-and-hold strategies for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT to provide context for trading effectiveness.

Trade history functionality must support filtering by date range, coin type, trade type (buy/sell), and profitability. Each trade record should include timestamp, asset pair, quantity, price, fees, profit/loss, and the technical indicators that triggered the trade. The system must support CSV export functionality for detailed analysis and tax reporting purposes.

The dashboard should provide controls for adjusting strategy parameters, enabling/disabling trading, and switching between live and paper trading modes. These controls must include appropriate safeguards to prevent accidental changes during active trading periods.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

The dashboard must be responsive and optimized for mobile devices, as traders often need to monitor positions while away from their primary workstation. Page load times should be under 2 seconds on standard broadband connections, with real-time updates delivered within 1 second of data changes.

Security is critical, requiring secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. The dashboard should implement session management, secure password requirements, and optional two-factor authentication. All sensitive operations should require confirmation to prevent accidental execution.

### Future Features Analysis

**Functional Requirements:**

The sentiment engine must collect data from Twitter/X and cryptocurrency news sources on an hourly basis. The system should implement rate limiting and API quota management to ensure sustainable data collection. Natural language processing should classify content sentiment as bullish, bearish, or neutral with confidence scores.

The system must detect unusual spikes in mention volume and sentiment for specific cryptocurrencies. This requires baseline establishment and statistical analysis to identify significant deviations. The engine should filter out spam, pump-and-dump schemes, and low-credibility sources through volume thresholds and source reputation scoring.

Integration with the main trading system should be optional and configurable. The sentiment engine should generate watchlist suggestions and alert notifications rather than directly executing trades, maintaining human oversight for high-risk decisions.

**Technical Considerations:**

The sentiment analysis component requires significant computational resources for natural language processing. Cloud-based AI services like Claude or OpenAI provide scalable solutions but introduce external dependencies and ongoing costs. The system should implement caching and batch processing to optimize API usage and costs.

Data storage requirements are substantial, as the system must retain historical sentiment data for trend analysis and model improvement. The database design should support efficient time-series queries and data archival strategies.

#### Smart Portfolio Allocation Engine

The portfolio allocation engine represents an advanced risk management system that dynamically adjusts capital allocation based on historical performance and market conditions. This component would optimize the balance between risk and reward through systematic rebalancing.

**Functional Requirements:**

The allocation engine must analyze historical trade performance metrics including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and volatility for each trading pair. The system should calculate optimal exposure levels based on risk-adjusted returns and correlation analysis between assets.

Dynamic rebalancing should occur based on predefined thresholds and market conditions. The system must support risk-on and risk-off modes, automatically adjusting USD reserve levels based on market volatility and portfolio performance.

Integration with the core trading engine requires careful coordination to avoid conflicts between allocation decisions and tactical trading signals. The system should implement priority mechanisms and conflict resolution strategies.

**Technical Considerations:**

The allocation engine requires sophisticated mathematical modeling and optimization algorithms. The system must process large datasets efficiently and perform complex calculations without impacting real-time trading performance.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture Overview

The cryptocurrency trading application follows a microservices architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns between data ingestion, trading logic, persistence, and user interface components. This design promotes scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation while supporting the real-time requirements of cryptocurrency trading.

The architecture consists of five primary components: the Market Data Service for real-time price feeds, the Trading Engine for signal generation and order execution, the Data Persistence Layer for trade logging and portfolio tracking, the Web Dashboard for user interaction, and the External Integration Layer for third-party services.

**Market Data Service**

The Market Data Service serves as the primary interface to Kraken's WebSocket API, maintaining persistent connections and handling real-time price updates. This service implements connection pooling, automatic reconnection logic, and data validation to ensure reliable market data flow. The service buffers incoming price data and distributes it to downstream components through an internal message queue system.

The service maintains sliding windows of historical price data necessary for technical indicator calculations. This includes configurable periods for moving averages, RSI calculations, and Bollinger Band computations. The windowing system must balance memory usage with calculation accuracy, typically maintaining 200-500 data points per trading pair.

Error handling within the Market Data Service is comprehensive, including WebSocket connection failures, malformed data packets, and API rate limiting. The service implements exponential backoff for reconnection attempts and maintains a local cache of the last known prices to support continued operation during brief outages.

**Trading Engine**

The Trading Engine represents the core intelligence of the system, implementing the technical analysis algorithms and risk management logic. The engine operates on a event-driven architecture, responding to price updates from the Market Data Service and generating trading signals based on configured strategies.

The engine implements multiple technical indicators simultaneously, combining signals through a weighted scoring system. RSI calculations identify overbought and oversold conditions, while Bollinger Bands detect volatility breakouts and mean reversion opportunities. Moving average crossovers provide trend confirmation, and volatility triggers help identify optimal entry and exit points.

Risk management is integrated throughout the trading logic, with position sizing based on available capital, volatility metrics, and USD reserve requirements. The engine automatically calculates the appropriate trade size to maintain the target USD extraction percentage while respecting maximum position limits and minimum trade sizes imposed by the exchange.

The USD reserve management system operates as a separate module within the Trading Engine, tracking profit extraction and redeployment decisions. This module maintains a target USD percentage and implements logic for partial redeployment during strong signal conditions. The system includes safeguards to prevent complete USD depletion and maintains minimum reserve levels for operational stability.

**Data Persistence Layer**

The Data Persistence Layer utilizes Supabase as the primary database platform, providing PostgreSQL-based storage with real-time capabilities and built-in authentication. The database design supports both transactional consistency for trade execution and analytical queries for performance reporting.

The trade logging system captures comprehensive information for each transaction, including pre-trade market conditions, signal strength, execution details, and post-trade analysis. This data supports both real-time dashboard updates and historical performance analysis. The system implements partitioning strategies to manage data growth and maintain query performance as trade volume increases.

Portfolio tracking maintains real-time balances across all trading pairs and USD reserves. The system implements double-entry accounting principles to ensure balance accuracy and supports reconciliation with exchange account balances. Historical portfolio snapshots enable performance tracking and support backtesting capabilities.

Google Sheets integration provides an additional logging layer and supports external analysis tools. The system maintains a master log sheet with all trades and creates monthly sub-sheets for detailed analysis. This dual logging approach provides redundancy and supports different analytical workflows.

**Web Dashboard**

The Web Dashboard implements a responsive React-based interface optimized for both desktop and mobile access. The dashboard connects to the backend through RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections for real-time updates. The interface design prioritizes clarity and accessibility, presenting complex trading data in intuitive visualizations.

The dashboard architecture separates presentation logic from business logic, with React components consuming data through a centralized state management system. Real-time updates utilize WebSocket connections to provide immediate feedback on portfolio changes, trade execution, and system status.

Mobile optimization addresses the unique requirements of cryptocurrency trading, where users frequently monitor positions outside traditional office environments. The mobile interface prioritizes essential information and provides streamlined controls for emergency actions such as disabling trading or adjusting risk parameters.

**External Integration Layer**

The External Integration Layer manages connections to third-party services including Kraken APIs, Google Sheets, and future AI services. This layer implements consistent error handling, rate limiting, and authentication across all external dependencies.

Kraken API integration includes both WebSocket connections for real-time data and REST API calls for order execution and account management. The integration implements comprehensive error handling for network failures, API errors, and rate limiting. The system maintains separate connection pools for different API endpoints to optimize performance and reliability.

The fallback queue system operates within this layer, storing pending operations during API outages and executing them when service is restored. The queue implements priority mechanisms to ensure critical operations such as stop-loss orders receive precedence during recovery periods.

### Scalability Considerations

The architecture design supports horizontal scaling through containerization and cloud deployment strategies. The Market Data Service can scale through multiple WebSocket connections and load balancing, while the Trading Engine supports multiple instances with coordination through the database layer.

Database scaling utilizes Supabase's built-in scaling capabilities, including read replicas for analytical queries and connection pooling for high-concurrency scenarios. The system design supports database sharding strategies for future growth, with trade data partitioned by time periods and portfolio data maintained in dedicated schemas.

The Web Dashboard scales through content delivery networks and caching strategies, with static assets served from edge locations and dynamic content cached at multiple levels. The API layer supports horizontal scaling through stateless design and external session management.

### Fault Tolerance and Resilience

The system implements multiple layers of fault tolerance to ensure continuous operation in the volatile cryptocurrency market environment. Circuit breaker patterns protect against cascading failures, while health monitoring provides early warning of system degradation.

Data redundancy spans multiple layers, with critical trade data stored in both Supabase and Google Sheets. The system implements automated backup strategies and supports point-in-time recovery for critical data loss scenarios. Configuration data is versioned and stored in multiple locations to support rapid system recovery.

The trading engine implements safe-mode operations during partial system failures, automatically reducing position sizes and increasing USD reserves when system reliability is compromised. This defensive approach prioritizes capital preservation over profit maximization during uncertain conditions.


## Technical Specifications

### Core Trading Engine Specifications

The trading engine represents the heart of the cryptocurrency trading application, implementing sophisticated algorithms for market analysis, signal generation, and risk management. Based on the research conducted on Kraken's API capabilities, the engine will utilize WebSocket connections for real-time market data and REST API calls for order execution.

**Market Data Processing Module**

The market data processing module establishes and maintains persistent WebSocket connections to Kraken's ticker channel at `wss://ws.kraken.com/v2`. The module subscribes to real-time price feeds for the five selected stablecoins, configuring the event trigger for trade-based updates to ensure maximum responsiveness to market movements. The WebSocket implementation includes comprehensive error handling for connection failures, malformed data packets, and API rate limiting scenarios.

The module maintains sliding windows of historical price data necessary for technical indicator calculations. For RSI calculations, the system maintains a 14-period window of price changes, while Bollinger Bands require a 20-period simple moving average with standard deviation calculations. Moving average crossovers utilize both short-term (5-period) and long-term (20-period) exponential moving averages to identify trend changes and momentum shifts.

Data validation occurs at multiple levels within the processing pipeline. Raw WebSocket messages undergo schema validation to ensure all required fields are present and properly formatted. Price data is subjected to sanity checks, including maximum percentage change thresholds and volume validation to detect potential data corruption or market manipulation attempts.

**Signal Generation Engine**

The signal generation engine processes validated market data through a multi-layered analysis framework that combines technical indicators with volatility assessment and trend confirmation. The RSI component identifies overbought conditions above 70 and oversold conditions below 30, with additional sensitivity adjustments based on recent volatility patterns.

Bollinger Bands analysis detects volatility breakouts when prices move beyond the upper or lower bands, indicating potential trend continuation or reversal opportunities. The system calculates band width to assess market volatility levels and adjusts position sizing accordingly. Narrow bands suggest low volatility with potential for significant price movements, while wide bands indicate high volatility requiring more conservative position management.

Moving average crossover analysis provides trend confirmation and momentum assessment. The system generates bullish signals when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, and bearish signals for the opposite condition. Signal strength is weighted based on the magnitude of the crossover and the slope of the moving averages to filter out false signals during sideways market conditions.

The volatility trigger component monitors price movement velocity and trading volume to identify optimal entry and exit points. High volatility periods with increasing volume suggest strong market conviction, while low volatility with declining volume may indicate consolidation phases suitable for range trading strategies.

**Risk Management System**

The risk management system implements multiple layers of protection to preserve capital and optimize risk-adjusted returns. Position sizing calculations consider available capital, current USD reserves, volatility metrics, and correlation analysis between trading pairs to prevent overexposure to similar market movements.

The USD reserve management system automatically extracts 10-15% of profits from each successful trade, transferring these gains to a separate USD balance that serves as both a profit lock mechanism and a source of capital for future opportunities. The extraction percentage is dynamically adjusted based on recent performance metrics and market volatility levels.

Stop-loss mechanisms are implemented at both the individual trade level and the portfolio level. Individual trades include automatic stop-loss orders placed at predetermined levels based on volatility-adjusted risk parameters. Portfolio-level stops monitor overall drawdown and automatically reduce position sizes or halt trading when predefined risk thresholds are exceeded.

The system includes position correlation analysis to prevent excessive exposure to similar market movements across different stablecoins. When correlation between trading pairs exceeds 0.8, the system reduces position sizes proportionally to maintain diversification benefits.

**Order Execution Framework**

The order execution framework interfaces with Kraken's authenticated WebSocket API at `wss://ws-auth.kraken.com/v2` for real-time order placement, modification, and cancellation. The system implements comprehensive order management including market orders for immediate execution, limit orders for price-specific entries, and stop-loss orders for risk management.

Order validation occurs before submission to prevent invalid orders that could result in API errors or unintended market exposure. Validation includes balance checks, minimum order size verification, price reasonableness assessment, and duplicate order detection to prevent accidental multiple submissions.

The execution engine implements intelligent order routing that considers market conditions, order book depth, and recent trading volume to optimize execution quality. During high volatility periods, the system may split large orders into smaller chunks to minimize market impact and improve average execution prices.

Error handling within the execution framework addresses various failure scenarios including insufficient funds, invalid trading pairs, market closures, and API connectivity issues. The system maintains a pending order queue that automatically retries failed orders when conditions improve, with exponential backoff to prevent API rate limit violations.

## Architecture Recommendations

### Addressing Core Architecture Questions

The original architecture plan raised several critical questions that require careful consideration to ensure optimal system design and operational effectiveness. These questions address fundamental aspects of system configuration, data management, user experience, and scalability that will significantly impact the application's success.

**USD Reserve Floor Configuration**

The question of whether to allow configurable USD "floor" amounts represents a crucial risk management consideration that directly impacts capital preservation and trading flexibility. Based on the analysis of market volatility patterns and risk management best practices, implementing a configurable USD floor provides significant advantages for both risk management and operational flexibility.

The recommended approach includes implementing a dynamic USD floor system that adapts to market conditions and portfolio performance. The base floor should be set at a minimum of 20% of total portfolio value during normal market conditions, with automatic increases to 30-40% during high volatility periods or significant market downturns. This adaptive approach ensures adequate capital preservation while maintaining sufficient flexibility for opportunistic trading.

The configuration interface should provide both absolute dollar amounts and percentage-based settings, allowing users to specify minimum USD reserves in terms that align with their risk tolerance and capital management strategies. Advanced users should have access to volatility-adjusted floor calculations that automatically increase reserve requirements during uncertain market conditions.

Implementation considerations include real-time monitoring of the USD floor ratio with automatic trading suspension when reserves approach minimum levels. The system should provide early warning notifications when USD reserves decline toward the configured floor, enabling proactive portfolio management and risk mitigation.

**Fallback Queue Manual Review Capabilities**

The implementation of manual review capabilities for fallback queue operations addresses the critical balance between automated efficiency and human oversight during system recovery scenarios. The recommended approach implements a tiered review system that provides appropriate oversight without unnecessarily delaying time-sensitive operations.

High-priority operations such as stop-loss orders and position liquidations should execute automatically upon system recovery without manual review, as delays in these operations could result in significant losses. Medium-priority operations including new position entries and profit-taking orders should be subject to optional manual review based on configurable thresholds and market conditions.

The manual review interface should provide comprehensive context for each queued operation, including market conditions at the time of signal generation, current market state, and potential impact on portfolio allocation. Review decisions should be logged with timestamps and reasoning to support post-incident analysis and system improvement.

Timeout mechanisms ensure that manual review requirements do not indefinitely delay trading operations. Operations pending review for more than a configurable period (recommended 15-30 minutes) should either execute automatically or be cancelled based on their priority level and current market conditions.

**Trade Notes and Attribution System**

The implementation of detailed trade notes and attribution provides valuable insights for strategy optimization and performance analysis. The recommended system automatically generates comprehensive trade attribution that captures the technical indicators, market conditions, and decision logic that triggered each trade.

Automated attribution includes RSI values, Bollinger Band positions, moving average signals, volatility scores, and sentiment indicators (when available) at the time of trade execution. This information is stored in structured format within the database and presented in human-readable format within the dashboard and exported reports.

Manual note capabilities allow users to add contextual information, market observations, or strategy adjustments that influenced trading decisions. The note system supports both free-form text and structured tags that enable filtering and analysis of trades based on specific conditions or strategies.

The attribution system includes correlation analysis that identifies which indicators or combinations of indicators produce the most successful trades. This analysis supports continuous strategy refinement and helps identify optimal parameter settings for different market conditions.

**AI Sentiment Integration with Dashboard**

The integration of AI sentiment signals with the dashboard requires careful consideration of information presentation and user workflow to ensure that sentiment data enhances rather than complicates trading decisions. The recommended approach implements sentiment information as a supplementary data layer that can be enabled or disabled based on user preferences.

Sentiment data presentation includes both current sentiment scores and historical trends for tracked cryptocurrencies. The dashboard displays sentiment strength, mention volume, and confidence levels alongside traditional technical indicators to provide comprehensive market context.

Timeline visualization shows sentiment evolution over various time periods, enabling users to identify sentiment trends and potential inflection points. Integration with trade history allows analysis of how sentiment conditions influenced past trading performance and strategy effectiveness.

Alert mechanisms notify users of significant sentiment changes or unusual activity patterns that may indicate emerging trading opportunities. These alerts are configurable based on sentiment thresholds, mention volume spikes, and correlation with price movements.

**Strategy Settings Dashboard Integration**

The integration of strategy settings within the dashboard provides essential operational flexibility while maintaining appropriate safeguards against accidental modifications. The recommended interface design separates routine monitoring functions from configuration changes to prevent inadvertent parameter adjustments.

Strategy parameter modification requires explicit navigation to a dedicated configuration section with appropriate access controls and confirmation mechanisms. Changes to critical parameters such as position sizing, risk thresholds, and USD extraction percentages require confirmation dialogs that display the potential impact of proposed changes.

Version control for strategy settings maintains a complete history of parameter changes with timestamps and user attribution. This capability supports rollback to previous configurations and analysis of how parameter changes affect trading performance over time.

Real-time validation ensures that parameter changes are mathematically sound and operationally feasible. The system prevents configurations that could result in invalid trading conditions or excessive risk exposure while providing clear feedback about parameter constraints and recommendations.

**Google Sheets Organization Strategy**

The organization of Google Sheets logging requires balancing accessibility, performance, and data management considerations. The recommended approach implements a hierarchical structure that supports both detailed analysis and long-term data retention while maintaining reasonable file sizes and access performance.

The master spreadsheet contains summary information and recent trading activity (last 30 days) with links to detailed monthly sheets. This structure provides quick access to current information while maintaining comprehensive historical records in organized monthly archives.

Monthly sheets include detailed trade information, technical indicator values, market conditions, and performance metrics for all trades executed during that period. Automated sheet creation occurs at the beginning of each month with appropriate formatting and formula setup.

Annual summary sheets aggregate monthly performance data and provide year-over-year comparison capabilities. These sheets include key performance metrics, strategy effectiveness analysis, and portfolio evolution tracking that supports long-term performance assessment.

Backup and archival procedures ensure that historical data remains accessible even as active sheets are archived or reorganized. The system maintains local backups of all Google Sheets data to protect against accidental deletion or service outages.
