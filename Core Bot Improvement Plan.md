# Core Bot Improvement Plan

**Goal:** Complete overhaul of crypto trading bot to remove meme bot functionality and focus entirely on optimizing a Core Bot that trades Layer 1 coins (BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA) on Kraken with the goal of outperforming buy-and-hold strategies in bull, bear, and sideways markets.

## Current System Issues (Pre-Phase 1)
- **P&L Calculation Bugs**: Showing impossible gains like $15,067.56 and $3,061,807.79
- **Price Mixing Issues**: Selling ETH at BTC prices ($106,871.06 for ETH)
- **Poor Performance**: 27.5% win rate, -$0.96 loss (-0.32% return) after 91 trades
- **Random Trading Logic**: No real technical analysis, just random buy/sell decisions
- **Resource Waste**: Meme bot consuming resources away from core performance
