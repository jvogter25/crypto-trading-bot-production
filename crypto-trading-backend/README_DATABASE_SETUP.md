## üîß Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the SQL Migration

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your `crypto-trading-v2` project

2. **Open the SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Run the Migration**
   - Copy the entire contents of `SUPABASE_SETUP.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL editor
   - Click "Run" to execute

4. **Verify the Setup**
   - Run this verification query:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   ORDER BY table_name;
   ```
   - You should see all 7 tables created

### Step 2: Test Database Connection

1. **Ensure your .env file has the correct credentials**:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
   KRAKEN_API_KEY=your_kraken_api_key
   KRAKEN_API_SECRET=your_kraken_api_secret
   ```

2. **Test the connection**:
   ```bash
   cd crypto-trading-backend
   npm run db:test
   ```

### Step 3: Start the Trading System

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```
